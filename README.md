This repo is dedicated to a recent exploration I've done on the effects of crowds on home court advantage in basketball. I think the noise and positive energy of a crowd motivates the home team to perform better and can account for most of the effect of home court advantage. The absence of crowds due to COVID restrictions is a great chance to test this hypothesis.

The notebook in this repo scrapes NCAA men's basketball data for games before and during COVID. The average point spread across these groups is compared for home and away teams to see if home court advantage disappeared when crowds weren't allowed to attend. It's a fun analysis that could be expanded to include other sports. Enjoy!
